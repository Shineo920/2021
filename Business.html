                Japanese billionaire arrives at ISS on space tourism trip ahead of SpaceX lunar journey
            </h2>

            <p>
                Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa arrived at the International Space Station on Wednesday, where he’ll spend nearly two weeks visiting as a private space tourist. Maezawa launched on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft along with production assistant Yozo Hirano
                and Roscosmos cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin. The Japanese entrepreneur booked the spaceflight through U.S. company Space Adventures, which has previously sent seven tourists to the space station on Russian vehicles.

                Elon Musk says ‘civilization is going to crumble’ if people don’t have more children
            </h2>

            <p>“It’s completely the opposite,” Musk said, urging people to look at the data. “If people don’t have more children, civilization is going to crumble. Mark my words.” When asked if this is why he has so many children, the father of six said
                he’s trying to set a good example, adding that he has to practice what he preaches. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note to investors in July that the “movement to not have children owing to fears over climate change is growing and
                impacting fertility rates quicker than any preceding trend in the field of fertility decline.” To support their argument, they pointed to surveys, academic research and Google data that shows climate change is directly and indirectly accelerating
                the decline in fertility rates.
