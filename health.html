          <h4>CAF AMERICA ENABLES TAX-EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO THE
            CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC</h4>
          <p>
            The World Health Organization has declared the novel coronavirus (SARS-Co-V-2) a global pandemic. The number of those showing symptoms of COVID-19 increases daily around the world with the virus affecting hundreds of thousands. Via CAF America, donors can make tax-receipted fully regulatory compliant contributions to support the work of hospitals, community-based organizations, and other charities that are mobilizing around the world to provide support to those affected by COVID-19.

          <p>
            A major distributor of COVID-19 vaccines internationally, GAVI’s COVAX program aims to provide 1.8 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses to the 92 of the world’s lowest-income countries in 2021 and early 2022. The only program of its kind, COVAX  allocates vaccines at a global level according to WHO guidance on most vulnerable populations (i.e. healthcare workers, then elderly populations, etc) as part of a worldwide effort to halt the spread of the pandemic.

          <p1>
            Habitat is responding to the joint public health and economic crisis of the COVID pandemic, serving communities we have helped build and those who are struggling or at greater risk of exposure to the virus due to lack of access to safe, decent shelter. As the virus has spread in secondary and tertiary waves in the South Asia region, Habitat and community partners are responding to meet immediate needs including food, hygiene supplies, WASH/handwashing facilities, livelihoods support, and shelter improvements  The attached slides outline the response strategies and modalities (e.g. conditional cash transfers) in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, focusing on marginalized communities and urban slum developments.
