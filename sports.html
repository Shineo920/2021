          <h4>Blazers guard CJ McCollum diagnosed with a pneumothorax</h4>
          <p>
            PORTLAND — Upon further examination, a CT scan revealed that Trail Blazers guard CJ McCollum has a pneumothorax (right lung), the team announced Tuesday.
            McCollum sustained the injury during the 4th quarter of Portland’s game against Boston on December 4.
            A pneumothorax is a collapsed lung that occurs “when air leaks into the space between your lung and chest wall,” according to the Mayo Clinic. This air pushes on the outside of your lung and makes it collapse. A pneumothorax can be a complete lung collapse or a collapse of only a portion of the lung. 
            McCollum will be further evaluated before a prognosis is determined and his status will be updated accordingly.   
            He did not travel with the team for Wednesday’s game at Golden State.   
            In 24 games this season (all starts), McCollum has averaged 20.6 points (42.4% FG, 39.3% 3-PT, 70.0% FT), 4.1 rebounds, 4.5 assists, 1.08 steals and 35.3 minutes.

            Indiana Pacers guard T.J. McConnell underwent right hand surgery and is expected to be out at least 10-12 weeks, the team announced. The surgery was done to repair a torn scapholunate ligament in his right wrist.
            McConnell played three minutes in a Dec. 1 loss against the Atlanta Hawks before exiting with the wrist injury.
            ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski first reported the surgery.

          <p1>
            The 2021-22 campaign will mark the 74th edition of the NBA on Christmas Day. The league began playing Christmas games in 1947, and will feature five games on the holiday.

            This season’s slate of Christmas games features former Kia Most Valuable Player Award winners (Giannis Antetokoumpo, James Harden, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Russell Westbrook and Stephen Curry), three of the four conference finalists from 2021 (Atlanta, Phoenix and Milwaukee) and a parade of young superstars (Trae Young, Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, Luka Doncic and Donovan Mitchell), too.
