        <h4>Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 medal designs unveiled</h4>
        <p>
          The Beijing 2022 medals - named "Tong Xin", meaning "together as one"
          - are composed of five rings and a centre; the design is based on
          Chinese ancient jade concentric circle pendants with the five rings
          representing the Olympic spirit to bring people together and the
          splendour of the Olympic Winter Games being shared all over the world.

          Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 - Updates on
          Spectators, Vaccination and COVID-19 Countermeasures
        </h4>
        <p>
          Considering the above objective, the IOC and IPC fully respect the
          principles established by Beijing 2022. These principles are based on
          wide-ranging consultations with international experts and the Chinese
          authorities, as well as the experience of Olympic and Paralympic
          stakeholders. The principles presented by Beijing 2022 will be
          detailed in the Playbooks. The first version of these Playbooks will
          be released in late October. A second version will then be published
          in December.

          The IOC and IPC welcome the decision to allow for the sale of tickets
          to spectators residing in Chinaâ€™s mainland. This will facilitate the
          growth of winter sports in China by giving those spectators a
          first-hand Olympic and Paralympic experience of elite winter sports,
          as well as bringing a favourable atmosphere to the venues. However,
          all parties feel for the athletes and the spectators from around the
          world, knowing that the restriction on spectators from outside
          mainland China had to be put in place in order to ensure the safe
          holding of the Games this winter. Further information about the
          implementation of these policies and additional information about
          COVID-19 countermeasures will be detailed in the Playbooks, which will
          be released in late October and December.

        <p>
          The Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 will take place between 4 and 20
          February, while the Paralympic Winter Games will be held from 4 until
